# Seddit

### Background

Seddit is a Reddit clone built as a single page application in Vanilla JavaScript. 


### [Live Demo](https://seddit.vercel.app/)



### [Original Spec](https://github.com/sseanik/Seddit/blob/master/SPEC.md)

This web application was developed for a Software Construction project where the backend was provided by course staff and the task was to write a javascript frontend. This program is based off an assignment I wrote in 2019 for COMP2041 written in Shell and Perl. The specification was provided by CSE staff. I have written all the code, and the spec is owned by UNSW CSE and the CS2041 course.
