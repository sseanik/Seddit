## Live Demo: https://seddit.vercel.app/


Seddit is a Reddit clone built as a single page application in Vanilla JavaScript. This web application was developed for a Software Construction project where the backend was provided by course staff and the task was to write a javascript frontend.

For further functionality in the demo, use the pre-typed credentials in the login modal.
