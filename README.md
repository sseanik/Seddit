# Seddit

### Background

Seddit is a Reddit clone built as a single page application in Vanilla JavaScript. It functions as a social news aggregation platform that allows users to influence the visibility of shared posts and comments.

### [Live Demo](https://seddit.vercel.app/)

For a non-logged in user, they will have limited visibility of features and are only able to browse 'Public Posts'. A dummy user (Mary) has been prefilled in the Login modal to view further demo functionality.

### [Original Spec](https://github.com/sseanik/Seddit/blob/master/SPEC.md)

This web application was developed for a Software Construction project in CS2041 where the backend was provided by course staff. I have written all the code, and the spec is owned by UNSW CSE and the CS2041 course.
